GitHub Actions vs Jenkins
======================
1. No need of extra tool
2. Integrations are easy like scanning tools other integrations are easy

3. You must use GitHub
4. We are loosing control

Workflow: an automation process in YAML that runs multiple jobs and triggered by events in GitHub

Events: any update in github repo can be considered as event, push to branch, create PR, merge PR, create issues, update tags, etc.

Job: is a collection of steps that can be executed in CICD process like checkout, build, scan, etc.

Actions: Like plugins in Jenkins, reusable snippets like checkout, setup terraform, etc. Adds extra functionality to our workflows

Runners: Agents in jenkins, where our workflows run. GitHub provides github hosted runners for few min. We can configure our own runners too i.e self hosted runners

get the inputs from user, you can trigger workflow manually. event should be workflow_dispatch

options
	time out
	at a time only one build should run
	repo-branch_name -> creates unique string with in repo
