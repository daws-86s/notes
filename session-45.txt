https -> how https works

SSL -> secure socket layer

public key and private key
===========================
public key kept in server
private key will be with us

someone encrypts a message with our public key can only be decrypted with private key

we must have one domain for https to work

we will generate public and private keys for our domain

popular vendors are there to validate the domains...

we will send our public key to that vendor...they will sign that public key

client -> daws86s.fun(this server will have our public key attested by vendor)

certificate will be downloaded to the client(browser)

client a simple random text message will be encrypted with this public key and sent to server

server decrypts that message and sent to client..if that message is same then it confirms client is speaking same server

every communication will be encrypted with that random message key

1. domain is mandatory
2. our public key should be signed by popular vendor
3. private key will be with us
4. SSL termination will be at the frontend load balancer.
