1. while upgrading application in one VM it is successfully upgraded by terraform and ansible
2. but later few days, we are not able to SSH into that, but application is running

something would have disturbed SSH in the VM, but not application, it keeps on running

while installing python3-devel in VM it is dependent on openssl-libs package.
openssl openssl-server openssl-libs(upgraded to new version while installing python3-devel)

version mismatch between openssl-libs and openssl-server already present in VM, SSH depends on this openssl
when this mismatch occured SSH broken and stopped

1. fix devops-practice AMI to have latest openssl
2. while installing python3-devel make sure openssl other packages also upgraded

DEV or NON-PROD -> we can use VPN to login to servers directly
PROD -> you should use VPN, connect to bastion and then to SSH servers

openvpnas
