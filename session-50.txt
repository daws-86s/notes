if we have 2 AWS accounts, how can we create resources using terraform

PROD=160885265516
DEV=752692907119

VPC Peering
DEV VPC
PROD VPC
VPC Peering
	Requestor
	Acceptor

Provider -> one AWS account will get one provider

VPC Peering
==========
same region, different accounts
DEV = Requestor
PROD = Acceptor

Peer owner is always the acceptor

Terraform import
=================
Terraform code -> Resources -> Statefile
Resources -> Terraform code

VPC -> vpc_id
SG -> sg_id and name
EC2 -> instance_id

1. Create one skelton resource block, no need to give any params
2. Then run terraform import using unique id
3. Terraform will fetch all the information and keep it in state file
4. Now complete the resource block by getting the values from state file

R53 -> old infra point
daws86s.test -> new infra -> FALB -> BALB -> Components -> DB

R53 -> new ALB

Terraform lifecycle
====================
SG is attached to EC2
EC2 is depending on SG

Destroy the resource first
Create new resource

need to create another resource first
change the EC2 reference to new SG
delete old SG

ASG
====
min=1
desired=1
max=10

5 instances are running

lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      min_size,
      max_size,
      desired_capacity,
    ]
  }
  
terraform target
===============
10 resources, I want to create only 1 resource

terraform target
