kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod pod-name
kubectl exec -it pod-name -- bash

Services
===========
pod to pod communication is not useful since pod IP are ephemeral. Services can acheive 1. pod to pod communication
2. load balancing
3. service name works as DNS too

1. ClusterIP -> default. your application is exposed within the cluster. like other pods can hit the service to get response

if you want application to expose outside world. 
2. NodePort
3. LoadBalancer

labels are used to select resources in kubernetes

cluster IP < node port 

ReplicaSet -> creates desired number of pod replicas based on selectors

Deployment
==========
1. stop the server
2. remove old code
3. download new code
4. restart the server

frontend:v1 -> 2

frontend:v2

1. create one pod with version as frontend:v2 and remove old frontend:v1
2. create another pod with version as frontend:v2 and remove old frontend:v1
