0-1024 system ports
few clusters will not allow to open these ports for non root containers

Volumes
========
pod is ephemeral
node is ephemeral

1. ephemeral
2. eternal

when pod is created, it takes some storage from underlying host. when pod is deleted storage is also deleted

ephemeral
==========
1. emptyDir -> this is the default storage allocated in the host until pod lives. when you have multiple containers in a pod that should have access to same storage.

2. hostPath

sidecar pattern. app container logs the transactions. sidecar access it and push to log storages like elk, etc.

sets
====
1. Replicaset
2. Deployment
3. Deamonset -> it will make sure one replica of pod runs in each and every node. we can ship the logs using daemonset by access host logs through hostPath. hostPath persist the data until the pod runs on the node.

monitoring of the node
4. Statefulset

DaemonSet
hostPath -> ephemeral storage used by pod to access the underlying host storage, this is not secure but in few situations like shipping the logs to external storage we are using hostpath with readonly access.

Perm volumes
===============
1. networking
2. storage
3. programming
4. os

HD(EBS) elastic block storage
=========
should be as near as possible to computer
data trasfer is very fast
can connect to only computer at a time
databases and OS should be in EBS

Drive(NFS) EFS(Elastic file storage)
======
should be anywhere in the network
data transfer is slow compared to EBS
can be used in multiple systems at a time
databases and os can't be used in EFS
you can keep files in EFS

1. static provisioning -> manually creating disks
2. dynamic provisioning -> pods can create disks dynamically whenever required

storage administration
===========
create storage and attach to server
add or reduce storage to the servers
remove storage

backup
restore
backup testing
data replication

k8 created some wraper objects called PVC, PV and storage class

create disk -> storage team
PV(Persistant volume) -> k8 admin team
claim/mount the disk -> devops

PV(Persistant volume) -> k8 object/resource equivalant to disk
PVC (Persistant volume claim) -> k8 object to mount the storage i.e PV

Son/Daughter Father and Mother

Son -> Mother -> Father -> Wallet
Pod -> PVC -> PV -> Disk

Son -> Mother -> Phonepe
Pod -> PVC -> Disk(Create and Mount)
