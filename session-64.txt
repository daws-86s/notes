Kubectl apply -f -> EKS master/cp

cp -> scheduler -> check node resources

nodeSelector -> based on node labels you can request scheduler to schedule the pod

taints and tolerations
======================
taint -> paint
toleration -> acceptance

a few nodes are tainted
* special hardware nodes -> GPU AI based appliactions
* specific firewalls -> DB are accepting connections from only specific nodes based on IP address
* high priority or dedicated host

project=roboshop:NoSchedule

if a node is tainted, scheduler will not schedule any pods in that node. if you want your pod schedule you need to add toleration, but still scheduler does not gaurentee in that tainted node

a node has already 3 pods running. now you tainted that node with

noSchedule -> dont schedule upcoming pods, dont disturb current pods
noExecute -> dont schedule upcoming pods, evict current pods
PreferNoSchedule -> 3 nodes. 1 node is tainted. 2 nodes resources are full.

schedule -> Execute

Affinity and Anti-affinity
==========================
or and
or -> out of 2 nodes select any one. anyone in 2
and -> I will give 2 parameters, match those 2

kubernetes.io/project: roboshop

scheduler query the nodes
* untainted nodes if no toleration is there
* tainted nodes too but with the matching toleration key and value

select names starting with r*
