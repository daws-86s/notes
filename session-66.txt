Pods, Service, ConfigMap, Deployment
apiGroup: v1, apps/v1, etc.

a group contains multiple resources. a person can perform acctions on resources

which group?

RoleBinding
ClusterRole -> cluster level resources
ClusterRoleBinding

cluster describe access

1. create IAM user
2. provide cluster describe access
3. create role and rolebinding
4. edit aws-auth config map
aws-auth is a config map where EKS and IAM are integrated

IAM authentication provider to EKS
Authorisation is handled by EKS Role and RoleBindings

kubectl get pods
