service account
===============
it is the non-human account with which pod runs. service accounts are useful for pods to get access to other resources like configmaps, secrets, other AWS services like secrets manager, paramter store, etc.

OIDC provider -> OpenID Connect -> used by k8s to connect with external identity providers.

eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster roboshop-dev --approve

eksctl create iamserviceaccount --cluster roboshop-dev --name secret-reader --namespace roboshop --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::160885265516:policy/RoboShopMySQLSecretReader --approve

Ingress Controller -> ALB -> AWS load balancer controller
==================
by default k8 service creates classic load balancer in AWS. it is legacy, AWS also not recommending this

we got application load balancer, it is intelligent. it can read the request and send to appropriate target groups

cart.daws86s.fun -> cart target group
catalogue.daws86s.fun -> catalogue target group
m.facebook.com -> mobile version of facebook

ALB -> Listener -> Rule -> TG -> VMs
ALB -> Listener -> Rule -> TG -> Pods

netbanking.icici.com -> ALB -> Listener -> Rule -> NB TG -> Pods
corporate.icici.com
