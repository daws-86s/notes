Merge vs Rabase
===============
1. Merge create extra commit called merge commit, that has 2 parents so it preserves history
2. Rebase does not not create extra commit, it rewrites the history by changing the commit IDS. It has linear history

If you are working on shared branches go with merge, if you are working on private branches or local branches go with rebase

How do we get conflicts?How to resolve them?
=======
2 persons started egg-dosa.

if Git finds diff code in the same line, it can't understand which one to keep, so it creates conflicts. so the persons who coded to conflicts should sit together and decide which one to keep and which one to discard.

Branching Strategy
==================
git model
github model
trunk based

main develop release bugs feature hotfix -> git model
main and feature -> github/feature branching model
main -> trunk based

long lived branches
short lived branches

main develop
feature hotfix bugfix release

main

develop
========
source: main
all development are reflected here...

short-lived
========
feature

source: develop
target: develop through PR

deploy into DEV environment, everything is working as expected in DEV environment

release
======
source: develop
QA, UAT -> bugs
you can create a simple bug fix branches. do the changes and raise PR to release branch

all bugs are fixed

you can go for PROD from here...

target: main -> PROD and develop tag them

hotfix
=======
source: main

hotfix/bug-1234R -> do the development changes deploy to DEV
merge back to main and release into PROD

target: main and development

this is suitable waterfall model kind of development, if your software has multiple versions supported and multiple devices

GitHub/feature branching Model
============
main and feature

a branch is handled by only one person.

a feature is created from main branch, do the development. CI pipeline will run
	clone build scans unit testing
merge to main branch -> develop, uat, sit, prod

same code goes to all environments -> whatever is tested in DEV should go all the way to PROD. only configuration changes

dev uat qa prod -> dont create branches for environments

Git Reset
==========
Changes undone

1. soft -> changes will  come to staging environment
2. mixed
3. hard
