pre-build ->how to trigger, env setup
build -> what to do
post-build -> after completion

declarative vs scripted pipeline

declarative -> latest from 2.0 jenkins. jenkins DSL on top of groovy. this is strictly evaluated before execution. if errors it will not run. It is like a wrapper jenkins created on top of groovy for strict evaluation

scripted -> purely groovy, it will execute at runtime. if error comes in middle it will stop. more control to handle things

Hybrid approach

GitHub -> Jenkins
