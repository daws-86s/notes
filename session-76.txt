unit testing -> functions are the basic blocks of applications
functional/component testing -> overall functionality with in the component
integration testing -> testing between the components
regression testing -> any new defects because of new changes
sanity testing -> after the release, is everything fine or not
end to end testing -> entire flow of the application
performance testing

login(string username, string password){
	boolean isSuccess = checkWithDB(username, password)
	if(isSuccess){
		showDashBoard()
	}
	if(failure){
		showError()
	}
}

valid tests -> success
failure test cases -> failure

code coverage -> 10 functions, if you write unit test cases for 9 functions. code coverage is 90%

infra security, application security, network security, data security

1. static source code analysis
2. static application security testing (SAST) -> fortify webinspect
3. open source vulnerability scans -> Nexus IQ, Blackduck
4. image scanning -> ECR scans, Trivy
5. dynamic application security testing -> Veracode

C1 C2
overall code = C1+C2
new code = C2-C1


Vulnerbalities -> coding blocks that can be exploited
