1. list of all the project codes, app codes -> roboshop, catalogue
2. Enable sonar scan for them, don't fail anything
3. Set the timeframe next 6 months to clear HIGH, CRITICAL for overall code
	* Overall code
	* New code
4. from next 1 month after, we will apply HIGH and CRITICAL quality gates for new code
5. So quality gates fails if new code is not good.
6. after 6 months set the quality code for overall code

Quality Gate: Scanning the code, finding the issues. fail the pipeline if the criteria does not match... we configured like 0 vulnerabilities, 0 bugs, 0 code smells, security rating A, maintainability rating A, reliability rating A, code coverage 80%

Quality Profiles: Rules for SonarQube while scanning the code. our organisation architects and senior developers

National Vulnerability Database -> US Official organisation
CVE -> Common Vulnerability Exposure ID -> MITRE funded by US Gov, Non profit

Redhat, Oracle, Microsoft, Google, Security Research, Bounty Programs, Internship programs, etc..

a ID is allocated to vulnerability

MITRE -> NVD -> CVE-HJFG-1234

metadata
=========
who manages that, OS package, app dependency
fix the criticality
which version?
who is the vendor?
which OS?
what is the fix? which upcoming version is fixing this


Scanning Tools
===============
reads our top level and low level dependencies. OS version, library name, version, etc.

NVD responds with known vulnerabilities and remedy fixes..

3 HIGH, 3 CRTICAL, 8 MEDIUM, 9 LOW -> full info

setup a quality gate to filter HIGH, CRITICAL and fail the pipeline

CVE-2025-61882

ATG Patchset Level: R12.ATG_PF.C.delta.10

Impact:
- Environment uses ATG delta 10.
- For CVE-2025-61882 mitigation, the required XDO patch is:
  Patch 38510732:R12.XDO.C (apply_mode=hotpatch)

1. query the dependabot alerts
2. json response
3. if high, critical and open then stop the pipeline
4. if no critical and high and open proceed the pipeline
