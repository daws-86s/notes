change is inevitable
infra changes
	existing services deprecation
	new services enable
	terraform version changes
	provider version changes
	module development and upgrades
	EKS upgrades
	migration
		on-premise -> cloud
		cloud -> another cloud
runtime version changes
	node:20 -> node:21
	new features release
	libraries version upgrade
	scans
devops process
	pipeline changes
	new projects configure devops
		jenkins pipeline creation
		github repos and settings
		k8 namespace RBAC Dockerfiles manifest
	existing projects migrate
		monolithic -> microservices

any project any programming language our standards and process is same

I have 8 years of total experience, latest 4 years into devOps and cloud earlier I worked in L2 support and I got a change into DevOps Cloud.

Here we are responsible for end to end application releases from DEV to PROD and infra automation. We are using Terraform infra automation, Jenkins for CICD, Docker and Kubernetes for containerisation, Git as source code management, Ansible for configuration management.

We use multiple strategies to make our applications stable. We migrated from DevOps to DevSecOps, shift left, build once and run anywhere.

We completely automated jenkins pipelines through jenkins shared libraries, we let developers only coding, remaining everything is taken care by us.

we implemented centralised pipelines. we are managing 50+ components through our centralised pipelines

DevOps team -> DEV Team

we meet with development understand their branching strategy, programming language, deployment platform, versions, how frequently they release

then we explain our devops process like the pipelines, if they require infra we can provision through terraform, creating their presence in all the devops related tools like sonar, jenkins, kubernetes, git, etc..

then we configure pipelines, check their manifests and dockerfiles, enable scans...

we explain the branching strategy we follow, we will do those settings..

we will help them to do DEV, QA, UAT deployments, scans, etc. We will be available 2 PROD deployments. if there are any issues we can clear. once the process is stable we will handover to their support team...

We are dealing with Microservices into K8 and monolithic applications in VM.

agile -> sprints

2/3/4 weeks one sprint

6 developers -> new features, bug fixes/improvements

10 tasks -> 2 tasks, 1 task, 3 tasks, -> scrum master

P1, P2, P3, P4 -> plan the timing
	Heading
	Description
	Assigned date
	planned completion
	how many hours spent
	description
TO-DO -> IN-PROGRESS -> DONE/BLOCKED -> TL Verify -> Approve -> COMPLETED

8 COMPLETED -> 2 backlogs
2 argocd
3 github
2 monitoring sessions
5 python sessions

feature branch -> DEV deploy -> functional tests
QA -> deploy -> integration tests -> results
UAT -> deploy -> regression tests, end to end test -> results

change request process

CR ticket
	Project Code
	App code
	image version -> 1.0.2
	deployment start time, end time
	description
	assigned_to
	recovery plan
	scan results, testing results
	DEV, UAT, QA 
	TL, Testing team, DM, Client approvals
	Trigger PROD -> jenkins.daws86s.fun/roboshop/catalogue -> 1.0.2

ECR
	Project Code
	App code
	deployment start time, end time
	description
	assigned_to
	recovery plan
	scan results, testing results
	DEV, UAT, QA 
	TL, Testing team, DM, Client approvals, CTO level
	
pipeline checks
	check the ticket
		is approved or not
		is deployment window now or not -> then we can allow PROD
		DEV, UAT, QA success or not
		
		then we trigger deployment into PROD
		helm recover to previous version, and pipeline failed
		
DevOps team -> 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks
	tasks
		new pipelines
		cart application devops
		eks upgrade
		terraform version changes
		poc on new scan trivy
		nodejs 22 nodejs 24
		jenkins agents should be upgraded to 24
		using ansible for VM deployments

Documentation -> we document everything. we use confluence
Mentorship -> I will mentor junior engineers
We will conduct a session every 2 weeks. any person in our team can discuss about new technology or new concepts.
